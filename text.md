Beatriz Cruz is a Filipino artist, womenswear fashion designer and the creative force of self-owned fashion brand BÉACRUZ.

She started her brand from a thesis project which then gave her a step forward to the fashion scene, making her dreams into reality and achieved the Top Designer Award at Fashion Week San Diego, and the Top Team Designer Award for Fashion Week San Diego: Art & Beauty Behind Fashion exhibition in partnership with Sotheby's New York hosted by The Art Renewal Center in 2020, and was given the very first Fashion Week San Diego: Ashley Nell Tipton Special Award the following year.

Bea specializes in bridal design, made-to-measure evening wear and luxury ready-to-wear pieces with subtle sophistication, elegantly intricate detailing and hand-sewn embroideries.

From conceptualization to design execution to garment construction, she pours passion into every stitch of every garment piece she creates, same goes to her artworks and in life, as both art and fashion are her prime storytelling medium, a realm where you get to hear her thoughts and where she gets to share her emotions to the world.
